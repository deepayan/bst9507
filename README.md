# 20th Century Code

This repository is purely of historical interest.

It contains code I wrote as a student at ISI, during the late 1990s upto mid-2000. Much of it was written to compile and run on a VAX VMS machine, and often targeted features specific to the dumb terminals (DEC vt100?) and line printers (DEC LA210) we used at the time.
